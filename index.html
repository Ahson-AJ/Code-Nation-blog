                <h2><u>About me</u></h2>
                <p class="main-text">
                    I am a IT/tech enthusiast and enjoy using and reading about new technologies, so I have decided to change careers and enter the tech developer sector for a more fulfilling career and a career that is more in line with my passions. I have been reading and learning about software development, and through this research I found Code Nation, and after reading about the companyâ€™s purpose and values, I thought that it would be great environment for me to develop as a programmer.
                    My time at code nation has been valuable, especially having a class environment to learn programming in a group setting and being able to share ideas and resolutions to problems and see how other people solve problems has been really beneficial.
